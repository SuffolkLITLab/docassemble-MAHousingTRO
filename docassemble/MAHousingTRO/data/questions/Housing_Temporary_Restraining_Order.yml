    Housing Temporary Restraining Order
  short title: |
    Housing TRO
  description: |
    This interview will help you ask the court for emergency help to stop your landlord from:

    * Locking you out of your home without a court order
    * Shutting off your utilities
    * Entering your home without permission
    * Violating your right to "quiet enjoyment" of your home

    You may also use this interview to ask the court to order your landlord
    to make repairs to your home or to pay you money.

    If your situation is more complex, you may want to use [GetUpToCode](https://getuptocode.org) instead. GetUpToCode
    can help you with more options to find and report housing problems, including the problems listed above.
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    This interview can be used by any tenant who is over 18. If you are being evicted in court, you should use
    [MADE](https://gbls.org/MADE) instead.
  before_you_start: |
    This interview will ask you questions about your landlord, your home, and the problems you are having.

    Before you start, make sure you have your landlord's contact information. If you think your landlord owes you money,
    you may also want to find any receipts.
