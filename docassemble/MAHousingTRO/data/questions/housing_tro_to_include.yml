  #### What is a breach of quiet enjoyment?
  A breach of quiet enjoyment is something that your landlord did or should
  have done that makes your home unlivable. This can cover a lot of different
  issues. The problem needs to be serious and you can get help for issues
  that the court agrees are emergencies with this form.
  
  Examples might include:
  
  * A sewage backup in your basement
  * A strong unpleasant odor
  * Constant noise at unreasonable times of day (remember, even if you are
  working from home, permitted construction may still be allowed)
  * Unsafe living conditions that your landlord isn't fixing
